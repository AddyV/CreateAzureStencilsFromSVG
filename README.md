Create Azure Stencils From SVG

This app was meant to create Visio stencils from SVG files downloaded from Microsoft, specifically, Azure icons from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/icons/

Steps -
1. Download the icons to C:\Temp\Azure_Public_Service_Icons (or any other folder)
2. Launch the app
3. Create the stencils by hitting the only button in the form
4. Wait while the app launches Visio, creates one stencil after the other, add images to each stencil, save & close the stencil
5. Close the app when Visio instance is terminated

Troubleshooting -
If something goes wrong, kill the app, and close any open instances of Visio and try again.
